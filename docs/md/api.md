# API

Here's the reference of the JavaScript (TypeScript) ssgo API.

> **Keep in mind that ssgo is built upon Deno, and so that the API intends to be used only from Deno scripts.**

## `buildTemplateToString`

Given the path of a template file and some context data, builds the HTML and returns it as string:

> _Type: `(templatePath: string, data: Record<string, any>, componentsDirPath?: string) => string`_

```typescript
import { buildTemplateToString } from "https://deno.land/x/ssgo/mod.ts"
import * as path from "https://deno.land/std@0.129.0/path/mod.ts"

const __dirname = path.dirname(path.fromFileUrl(import.meta.url))
const template = `${__dirname}/template.html`
const components = `${__dirname}/components`

const page = await buildTemplateToString(template, { name: "Bob" }, components)
```

**Please note that `ssgo` expects absolute paths for the `templatePath` and `componentsDirPath` arguments.**

This API aims to expose more features in the future. **If you have an idea of something useful that could be added to it, please feel free to <a href="https://github.com/mdubourg001/ssgo/issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">fill and issue</a>.**
